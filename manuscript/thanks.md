# Thanks

I would like first to say thanks to *Isaac Roldán*, friends since we met at the University and later workmate at Redbooth. Nowadays, we are working together on new exciting projects. Together we have learnt a lot of concepts, libraries, we've developed a lot of apps and become better developers. I hope this book helps him to absorb all the reactive concepts.

I would also like to thank the big community behind the iOS/OSX development especially to tools like [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) that make our daily work easier and fluent. Thanks to all these developer that unselfishly work on the platform and have allowed a big source of reusable components that without them it would have been almost impossible.

The community behind **ReactiveCocoa** and **RXSwift** also deserve big thanks because they have made possible the use of Reactive concepts with Swift. They designed both libraries with the advantages that Swift offers as a language *(generics, type safety, type inference, functional concepts)*.

And lastly, I would like to thank all the reviewers that helped me with a lot of feedback about the content, structure, typos, ... Since the first day that I announced I was going to publish the book they supported the idea and made this book possible:
